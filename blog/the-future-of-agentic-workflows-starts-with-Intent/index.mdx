🔥 **What if managing AI agents was as simple as deploying Kubernetes?**

We're launching the **Alpha version** and inviting early adopters to shape the next evolution in *context-driven AI infrastructure*.

*MCP Intent-Based Server: Simplifying Context for Complex AI Integrations*

## 💡 Why This Matters

Let's face it—enterprise AI integrations are messy. Context gets lost. Tools don't talk. Developers waste hours wiring things together, only for it to break silently in production.

**Agentico is building a new foundation**, not another abstraction.

We've launched the **MCP Intent-Based Server (Alpha)**:  
A dynamic, declarative server for managing the **tools, transports, and context** dynamically in AI systems—driven by one simple truth:

> 🧠 *The intent should drive the system—not the other way around.*

---

## 🔍 What's Under the Hood?

Our alpha release is powered by 3 breakthrough concepts:

1️⃣ **Kubernetes-style Manifests**  
Declare what you want (tools, prompts, connections) in a simple `server.yaml`. The server reconciles actual vs desired state—automatically.

2️⃣ **Temporal-like Paths for Tools**  
Structure your workspace like Temporal [activities and workflows](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/typescript/core-application). Just define `toolsPaths`, and the server loads, manages, and adapts to what you define—dynamically.

3️⃣ **Java Reflection-like Tool Injection**  
Create new tools on the fly from tool names in your manifest. No need to touch core server code. It's plug-and-play for AI capabilities.

> ❓If Kubernetes abstracted compute through intent, what would it look like to do the same for **MCP Servers**?

We're betting this is it.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

Whether you're:

- A **platform engineer** building internal AI services,
- A **data scientist** wanting plug-and-play tooling,
- Or a **startup** pushing toward agentic systems in production,

**This toolkit is your playground**.

We've abstracted the chaos, not the control.

## 🚀 Alpha Features You Can Use *Today*

- ☑️ Declarative server setup via `server.yaml`
- ☑️ Dynamic tool creation & registration
- ☑️ Transport flexibility (`stdio`, HTTP, custom)
- ☑️ Support both [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#server) and standard [server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#low-level-server) types. (The `McpServer` provides access to the server, but read-only access)
- ☑️ Tool lifecycle management: register/unregister on manifest change
- ☑️ Built-in logging for debugging

## 🧭 Looking Ahead

We're already building:

- Multi-server support for scale-out deployments
- Telemetry, observability & versioning
- Native gRPC + custom transports
- Integrated rollback strategies

This is just Day 1.

We want to hear from you. What do you need? What are your pain points? How can we make this even better?
