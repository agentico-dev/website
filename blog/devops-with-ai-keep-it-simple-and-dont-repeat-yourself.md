# KIS and DRY with AI

In DevOps, it is highly important to keep us DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in daily tasks, troubleshooting, and coding, do you agree?

To achive success you need to keep it simple (KIS), at least at the begining, when we are working with a lot of tools, scripts, and commands, we want to make sure that we are not overcomplicating things.

<!-- truncate -->

I tend to use the same commands over and over again, and when that happens, when I start noticing a pattern, I try to automate it with a script for simplicity and efficiency, and sometimes TypeScript or Java if it's a complex task. Let me tell you, about a game-changer tool that I've been using recently, this allows me to run my scripts in a more friendly way, I can reuse them, and I can share them with my team, the best of all is that it allows new team members to run the scripts without deep knowledge of the code or sintaxis.

This tool is called Agentico, Agentico leverages the power of Agentic AI and a protocol that allows you to expose your scripts as APIs (kind of) and being consumed by Claude, which inherently gives you a natural language interface to run your scripts! Isn't that bloody awesome!?

How is that possible? Well, Agentico is a facade powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) which can run your scripts from your local machine, which in my case is a great advantage because I don't have to install anything else, I just need to have Node.js installed, and of course, install the Claude Desktop App.
