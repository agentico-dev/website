## You Might Already Have an MCP Server Without Knowing It

If you have an **[OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) (OAS) or [gRPC IDL](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/)**, you're closer to running an **[MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples)** than you think. You've already done **10%** of the work by defining your API. But what about the rest?

### The Challenge: Bridging the Gap Between Specs and Execution

Most API development starts with a contract; an OAS document or a gRPC IDL that defines endpoints, request/response structures, and data types. These specs are critical, but they're **not enough** to make your API fully functional within an **agentic AI system**.  

Building an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** typically requires:  

- Generating code from API specs  
- Implementing business logic  
- Managing authentication and request flow  
- Ensuring compatibility with agentic AI tools  

### The 80% You Don't Have to Build

This is where **[Agentico](https://app.agentico.dev)** changes the game. Instead of manually writing boilerplate code and setting up integrations, Agentico **automatically generates** the missing 80%; turning your API specs into a fully functional MCP Server.  

What's left? Just **10% customization** to fine-tune integrations and business logic.  

### Why This Matters

Agentico **accelerates** the adoption of agentic AI by making API-driven automation seamless. Whether you're exposing LLMs, orchestrating AI workflows, or connecting services, you don't need to build from scratch anymore.  

### Get Started

You've already done the first 10%. The other 80%? **Let Agentico handle it.**
