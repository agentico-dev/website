This leads to fragile and high-maintenance integrations, where every new API feels like \\"yet another server\\" to configure and babysit. Our new intent-based AI for MCP flips that paradigm: you declare **what** you need (\\"*fetch user profile*,\\" \\"*process payment*\\"), and the engine figures out **how** to wire up the right tools, auth, and transports automatically.  \\n\\nThis shift slashes integration time by up to 50%, cuts maintenance overhead by hundreds of engineering hours annually, and unlocks agile innovation\u2014freeing teams to build products instead of maintaining servers, empowering engineers, delighting product leaders, and delivering measurable cost, time, and risk savings.\\n\\n<MCPArchitectureDecouple width=\\"80%\\" height=\\"auto\\" style={{ margin: \\"0 auto\\", display: \\"block\\" }} />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udea4 The Server\u2011First Trap  \\n\\nTraditional MCP integrations force you to treat each API as its own micro\u2011server: you analyze the API surface, model data, write client boilerplate, configure auth, set up transports, and stitch workflows together.\xa0For every new integration, you\u2019re repeating this process, spinning up a fresh server and build pipeline.\\n\\n* High maintenance: Each integration accumulates hundreds of lines of custom code and requires ongoing bug fixes when APIs change. Edge cases and 3rd party dependencies add complexity, making the [integration process even more cumbersome and endless](https://www.merge.dev/blog/a-guide-to-application-integration-maintenance).\\n* Engineering fatigue: Teams can spend 30\u201350% of their time on integration maintenance rather than feature work, with complex integrations costing upwards of $30K in engineering hours per project. - [API Integration cost](https://www.netguru.com/blog/api-integration-cost)\\n* Fragile code: Custom plumbing tends to break when upstream services evolve, leading to costly firefighting and regressions.\\n\\nThis \\"server\u2011first trap\\" creates overhead that saps momentum and frustrates both engineers and stakeholders.\\n\\n* **Example:** A team spends weeks integrating a new payment processor, only to find that the API has changed, breaking their integration. They scramble to fix it, diverting resources from other critical projects.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd28 Tools as the New Primitives  \\n\\nThe protocol\'s true power lies in **tools**\u2014self\u2011contained actions (APIs, scripts, connectors) that an LLM can invoke at runtime. It\'s like USB\u2011C: you don\'t rebuild your computer to add storage; you just snap it in the device. \\n\\nImagine traditional development as building a house brick by brick, where each brick represents a line of code. In contrast, using code generation and intent-based approaches is like assembling a house with prefabricated modules\u2014faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.\u200b\\n\\n![Modular Construction](./mcp-modular-construction.png)\\n\\n* Declare \\"what\\": You specify intentions like \\"create issue,\\" \\"fetch user profile,\\" or \\"process payment.\\"\\n* Automated wiring: The platform infers \\"how\\" by selecting the right tool, setting up auth, and choosing transports.\\n* Lower overhead: No more hand\u2011coded connectors or brittle middleware\u2014tools replace thousands of lines of glue code.\\n\\nThanks to MCP, modern LLMs can plug into a wide range of tools (APIs, databases, and other services); this allows them to perform complex tasks without needing to understand the underlying infrastructure. By treating tools as first-class citizens, LLMs can leverage their capabilities to enhance their performance and provide more accurate results. This tools\u2011first mindset accelerates development cycles and boosts collaboration across roles.\\n\\nLeveraging Intent-based-AI for MCP with code generation and low-code platforms, you can automate the wiring of tools, reducing the need for custom code and allowing developers to focus on defining their intent rather than the underlying implementation details. This shift from a server-first approach to a tools-first mindset enables faster development cycles, improved collaboration, and a more efficient use of resources.\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd16 Meet Intent\u2011Based AI for MCP\\n\\nOur new MCP engine flips the script: you write simple, declarative intent manifests\u2014no custom server code.\\n\\nMore about this:\\n* [The Future of Agentic Workflows Starts with Intent](/blog/the-future-of-agentic-workflows-starts-with-Intent)\\n* [From API Specs to MCP Servers](/blog/from-api-specs-to-mcp-servers-and-tools)\\n\\n### How it works\\n1. **Intent definition:** You define your intent in a simple, declarative format in manifest files (JSON  or YAML), like Terraform and other DevOps tools do for [infrastructure as code](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/infrastructure-as-a-code). This allows you to specify what you want to achieve without worrying about the underlying implementation details.\\n2. **Automatic wiring:** The engine figures out the right tools, auth, and transports to execute your intent. Intent-based AI automates server plumbing so devs can focus on the tool intents\u2014just like code-gen platforms free devs from scaffolding.\\n3. **Declarative intent:** With this new intent\u2011based AI for MCP, you **declare** your intent\u2014\\"I need a database read,\\" \\"I need a payment processed\\"\u2014and the engine selects, wires, and executes the right toolchain, producing a new MCP Server on the fly.\\n\\n\\n```yaml\\n# server.yaml\\n# for simplicity, we show only the relevant parts of the intent-based server.\\n# The full specification can be found in the https://intent-based.ai website and our docs.\\ntools:\\n  - name: reverse\\n    description: Reverses the input string\\n    schema:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        input:\\n          type: string\\n          description: The string to reverse\\n\\n  - name: uppercase\\n    description: Converts the input string to uppercase\\n    schema:\\n      type: object\\n      properties:\\n        input:\\n          type: string\\n          description: The string to convert to uppercase\\n```\\n\\nThe entry point of the application (`index.ts`) is remarkably simple:\\n\\n```typescript\\n#!/usr/bin/env node\\nimport createServerFromFile from \\"@agentico/mcp-intent-based\\";\\n\\nasync function startServer() {\\n  const server = await createServerFromFile();\\n  // Yes, that\'s all you need to do to start the server with Agentico and Intent Based AI!!\\n  // server.yaml dictates the tools to be created\\n}\\n\\nstartServer().catch((error) => {\\n  console.error(\\"Error starting server:\\", error);\\n  process.exit(1);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n- **Alpha release:** Explore it now on\xa0GitHub \u2192 https://github.com/agentico-dev/mcp or in NPM registry: [Server](https://agentico.dev/docs/intent-based-mcp) and [tools examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentico/mcp-intent-based-demo).\\n- **Community feedback:** We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to enhance the intent-based AI for MCP.\\n- **Future vision:** This is just the beginning; we envision a world where you can declare your intent and let the engine handle the rest, making integrations as easy as plugging in a USB device.\\n\\n### Real\u2011World Validation\\n\\n* [Capital One\'s approach to Intent-Based Engineering (IBE)](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/software-engineering/what-is-intent-based-engineering/) emphasizes the importance of declarative programming in reducing operational overhead. By allowing developers to focus on defining their intent rather than the underlying implementation details, IBE streamlines the development process and enhances productivity. \\n\\n* Prodvana reports that teams using [intent-based deployments](https://www.prodvana.io/blog/intent-based-deployments#The-Impact-of-Prodvana) experienced up to **50 times more frequent deployments**, indicating a significant boost in deployment efficiency.\\n\\nThese case studies underline that intent\u2011based approaches aren\u2019t theoretical\u2014they deliver measurable agility and reliability wins.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcbc **Business Impact First**\\n\\nIntent\u2011based AI for MCP accelerates time\u2011to\u2011market, drives cost efficiencies, and de\u2011risks tool integrations, imagining a world where you can focus on your product and let the engine handle the rest. Declare features as intents; the runtime auto\u2011selects APIs and workflows\u2014no custom glue code. This is a game changer for product teams, enabling faster iterations and more reliable integrations for MCP.\\n\\n* **Cost Savings:** Reduced development time translates to lower labor costs.\u200b\\n* **Revenue Growth:** Faster feature releases can lead to quicker monetization opportunities.\u200b\\n* **Risk Mitigation:** Standardized, AI-assisted code reduces the likelihood of human errors.\u200b\\n\\nMetric | Impact\\n--- | ---\\nTime to market | 50% faster integrations with [intent-based deployments](https://www.prodvana.io/blog/intent-based-deployments) \u2192 weeks shaved off release cycles\\nCost savings | Eliminates $30K+ per [integration cost](https://www.netguru.com/blog/api-integration-cost) in custom code upkeep.\\nRisk reduction | Standardized, AI\u2011driven wiring [cuts production incidents by 47%](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Santosh-Ratna-Deepika-Addagalla/publication/390835374_Engineering_in_the_Age_of_AI_Leveraging_Copilot_for_Enhanced_Software_Development/links/67ffb3e9df0e3f544f4257c4/Engineering-in-the-Age-of-AI-Leveraging-Copilot-for-Enhanced-Software-Development.pdf).\\nDeveloper delight | Copilot\u2011style productivity gains let [engineers focus on value creation, not plumbing](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe future of MCP is **tools first**.\\n\\nPicture this:\\n> - **Servers:** Building a power plant for every new appliance.  \\n> - **Tools:** Plug\u2011and\u2011play extension cords\u2014declare you need power, and the outlet does the rest.\\n> - **Intent-based AI:** A smart home assistant that understands your needs and automatically connects the right appliances to the power source.\\n\\nLet go of the server\u2011first grind.

Instead of simply declaring your intent to process payments, you have to set up a new server, configure the API client, handle authentication, and manage the data flow. This is not only time-consuming but also leads to a lot of boilerplate code that needs to be maintained over time.\\n* **Example:** A team spends weeks integrating a new payment processor, only to find that the API has changed, breaking their integration. They scramble to fix it, diverting resources from other critical projects.\\n* **Example:** A product manager is frustrated because the engineering team is spending more time maintaining integrations than building new features. They realize that the server-first approach is hindering their ability to innovate and respond to market demands.\\n* **Example:** A startup is struggling to keep up with the pace of change in their industry because their engineering team is bogged down by the complexity of managing multiple servers and integrations. They realize that they need a more efficient way to handle these integrations to stay competitive.\\n* **Example:** A company is facing delays in launching new features because their engineering team is spending too much time on integration maintenance. They realize that the server-first approach is slowing them down and preventing them from delivering value to their customers.

to shape the next evolution in *context-driven AI infrastructure*.\\n\\n*MCP Intent-Based Server: Simplifying Context for Complex AI Integrations*\\n\\n<MCPIntentServerDiagram alt=\\"MCP Intent Based Server and Tools\\" width=\\"75%\\" height=\\"auto\\" style={{ margin: \\"0 auto\\", display: \\"block\\" }} />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Why This Matters\\n\\nLet\'s face it\u2014enterprise AI integrations are messy. Context gets lost. Tools don\'t talk. Developers waste hours wiring things together, only for it to break silently in production.\\n\\n**Agentico is building a new foundation**, not another abstraction.\\n\\nWe\'ve launched the **MCP Intent-Based Server (Alpha)**:  \\nA dynamic, declarative server for managing the **tools, transports, and context** dynamically in AI systems\u2014driven by one simple truth:\\n\\n> \ud83e\udde0 *The intent should drive the system\u2014not the other way around.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd0d What\'s Under the Hood?\\n\\nOur alpha release is powered by 3 breakthrough concepts:\\n\\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Kubernetes-style Manifests**  \\nDeclare what you want (tools, prompts, connections) in a simple `server.yaml`. The server reconciles actual vs desired state\u2014automatically.\\n\\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Temporal-like Paths for Tools**  \\nStructure your workspace like Temporal [activities and workflows](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/typescript/core-application). Just define `toolsPaths`, and the server loads, manages, and adapts to what you define\u2014dynamically.\\n\\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Java Reflection-like Tool Injection**  \\nCreate new tools on the fly from tool names in your manifest. No need to touch core server code. It\'s plug-and-play for AI capabilities.\\n\\n> \u2753If Kubernetes abstracted compute through intent, what would it look like to do the same for **MCP Servers**?\\n\\nWe\'re betting this is it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Who Is This For?\\n\\nWhether you\'re:\\n\\n- A **platform engineer** building internal AI services,\\n- A **data scientist** wanting plug-and-play tooling,\\n- Or a **startup** pushing toward agentic systems in production,\\n\\n**This toolkit is your playground**.\\n\\nWe\'ve abstracted the chaos, not the control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Alpha Features You Can Use *Today*\\n\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Declarative server setup via `server.yaml`\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Dynamic tool creation & registration\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Transport flexibility (`stdio`, HTTP, custom)\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Support both [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#server) and standard [server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#low-level-server) types. (The `McpServer` provides access to the server, but read-only access)\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Tool lifecycle management: register/unregister on manifest change\\n- \u2611\ufe0f Built-in logging for debugging\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcec Want Early Access?\\n\\nJoin the alpha program, contribute ideas, and shape the future of **Model Context Protocol** in real enterprise scenarios.\\n\\n\ud83d\udee0 [GitHub Repo with example](https://github.com/agentico-dev/mcp)  \\n\ud83d\udce9 [Subscribe for updates](https://go.rebelion.la/agentico-news)  \\n\ud83c\udfa5 [Follow us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/larebelion-labs/) and [Adrian\'s](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=PEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=adrianescutia)\\n\\n\ud83e\udde2 [La Rebelion Merch](https://go.rebelion.la/merch).\\n\\n## \ud83d\udce2 Our different blogs:\\n\\n- [La Rebelion](https://rebelion.la) - Topics around Cloud Native, Kubernetes, and DevOps.\\n- [Agentico](https://agentico.dev) - Topics around Agentic workflows, MCP, and AI.\\n- [Intent Based AI](https://intent-based.ai) - The specs and the tools to help you with Intent Based AI.\\n- [MCP](https://mcp.com.ai) - Our hub for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the tools we are building around it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udded Looking Ahead\\n\\nWe\'re already building:\\n\\n- Multi-server support for scale-out deployments\\n- Telemetry, observability & versioning\\n- Native gRPC + custom transports\\n- Integrated rollback strategies\\n\\nThis is just Day 1.\\n\\nWe want to hear from you.

Think of it like a universal translator that lets different AI components (whether they\'re chatbots, data processors, or workflow orchestrators) work together smoothly. By implementing MCP servers, developers can create more complex and capable AI systems without worrying about the nitty-gritty details of how each component communicates. By using MCP servers, businesses can build more sophisticated AI systems that can handle a variety of tasks, from customer service to data analysis, all while ensuring that the components work together seamlessly.\\n\\nThis is especially important in today\'s landscape, where AI systems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected. The Model Context [**Protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) allows for seamless integration of various AI models, enabling them to share context, data, and functionality in a standardized way.\\n\\n### The Role of the Model Context Protocol\\n\\nThe **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the backbone that enables these seamless interactions. It defines how AI models share context, handle requests, and manage data flow. This standardized approach not only reduces development risks but also helps in cutting down operational costs by streamlining integration efforts. Whether you\'re exposing large language models (LLMs) or orchestrating complex AI workflows, MCP servers are designed to make your life easier.\\n\\nA new kind of [cloud service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) is emerging, one that can host multiple MCP servers and allow them to communicate with each other.

Instead of manually writing boilerplate code and setting up integrations, Agentico **automatically generates** the missing 80%; turning your API specs into a fully functional MCP Server.  \\n\\nWhat\'s left? Just **10% customization** to fine-tune integrations and business logic.  \\n\\n### Why This Matters\\n\\nAgentico **accelerates** the adoption of agentic AI by making API-driven automation seamless. Whether you\'re exposing LLMs, orchestrating AI workflows, or connecting services, you don\'t need to build from scratch anymore.  \\n\\n### Get Started\\n\\nYou\'ve already done the first 10%.

While some envision a future where AI autonomously builds its own agents, the current reality is different. Today, **building effective AI agents is still a software engineering challenge** - one that requires careful design, the right frameworks, and seamless system integration.  \\n\\nThe misconception? Many believe that AI agents require machine learning expertise. But in reality, **building AI agents is more like developing microservices** - it\'s about structuring software components, defining APIs, and ensuring smooth communication between systems.  \\n\\n<MicroservicesArchitecture width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"Microservices Architecture\\" />\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn this post, we\'ll break down how AI agents work, why **you don\'t need ML to build them**, how to integrate them with existing systems using **[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP)**, and how to avoid common pitfalls like **spaghetti code** when developing agentic architectures.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n## Understanding AI Agents: More Software Engineering Than ML\\n\\nAI agents are **software components that act autonomously** based on inputs from users, data sources, or other systems. They can handle tasks such as:  \\n- Automating workflows (e.g., AI copilots in DevOps)  \\n- Interacting with APIs and databases  \\n- Performing decision-making based on predefined rules or AI models  \\n- Responding to user prompts (like ChatGPT, but customized for specific use cases)  \\n\\nBut here\'s the catch: **not all AI agents require machine learning or deep learning**. Many can be designed using **rule-based logic, [deterministic workflows](./from-automated-to-agentic-the-future-of-enterprise-workflows), and structured APIs** - just like how traditional enterprise software is built.  \\n\\nThis is where the **microservices analogy** makes sense. AI agents, much like microservices, work as independent components that need well-defined boundaries, modular design, and effective communication mechanisms to function effectively.  \\n\\n### AI Agents vs. Microservices: The Architectural Similarities\\n\\n| Feature | Microservices | AI Agents |\\n|---------|-------------|-----------|\\n| **Modularity** | Small, independent services | Small, task-specific AI agents |\\n| **Communication** | API-based (REST, gRPC, etc.) | API-based (chat interfaces, **MCP**, etc.) \u2b50 |\\n| **State Management** | Stateless or stateful | Often stateless but can maintain context |\\n| **Scalability** | Scales horizontally | Can spawn multiple agent instances |\\n| **Deployment** | Containerized, serverless, or on-prem | Containerized, serverless, or embedded in applications |\\n\\nLike microservices, AI agents can be composed together to form **larger, more complex AI-driven solutions**. The key to success? **Choosing the right framework and integration method** - which brings us to Model Context Protocol (MCP).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Model Context Protocol (MCP): The Key to Seamless AI Integration\\n\\nOne of the biggest roadblocks to AI adoption in enterprises is **integration with existing systems**. Most companies operate legacy software, ERP systems, and internal APIs that aren\'t AI-ready. Without a proper integration layer, AI agents remain disconnected from the tools they\'re meant to enhance.  \\n\\n### What is MCP?\\n\\n**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a framework that allows **AI models to integrate with your existing software infrastructure**, acting as an intermediary between **LLMs and enterprise systems**.  \\n\\nIt enables:  \\n- **Context-aware AI interactions**: AI agents can pull relevant data from internal systems before generating responses.  \\n- **Secure access to back-office APIs**: Ensuring AI agents operate within predefined boundaries.  \\n- **Standardized communication**: Reducing the complexity of AI model interactions with structured systems.  \\n\\nWith MCP, businesses don\'t need to **rebuild their infrastructure from scratch** - they can **expose existing interfaces to AI models** in a controlled and scalable way.  \\n\\n### Why MCP is a Game-Changer for AI Agents\\n\\nLet\'s take an example, following the same analogy of **AI agents as microservices**.  \\n\\n<MCPMicroservicesArchitecture width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"MCP Microservices Architecture\\" />\\n\\nImagine you\'re building an **AI-powered customer support agent** for a bank. Without MCP, you\'d have to:  \\n1. Hardcode API calls for every possible banking function (balance inquiry, transaction history, loan applications, etc.).  \\n2. Build a **custom middleware** to authenticate and manage interactions between AI and backend systems.  \\n3. Maintain constant updates to ensure compatibility with evolving APIs.  \\n\\nWith MCP, the AI agent can:  \\n\u2705 **Understand the API structure dynamically** and adapt its requests accordingly.  \\n\u2705 **Authenticate securely** without exposing sensitive credentials.  \\n\u2705 **Interact with back-office systems** without complex custom development.  \\n\\nEssentially, MCP **reduces friction** between AI models and business applications, making it easier to **deploy, scale, and maintain AI agents** in real-world environments.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Avoiding Spaghetti Code in AI Agent Development\\n\\nOne of the biggest risks in AI development is **poor architecture**. Many teams rush to build AI agents without considering **scalability, maintainability, and modularity**. The result? **Spaghetti code** - a tangled mess of scripts, dependencies, and workarounds that becomes a nightmare to maintain.  \\n\\n### Common Pitfalls in AI Agent Development\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded API Calls**  \\n   - Instead of dynamically adapting to system changes, some AI agents rely on static, hardcoded API endpoints.  \\n   - **Solution**: Use an abstraction layer (like MCP) to ensure flexibility.  \\n\\n2. **Lack of Modularization**  \\n   - Many AI implementations mix business logic, AI interactions, and system integrations in a single codebase.  \\n   - **Solution**: Follow **separation of concerns** - keep AI logic separate from system integration layers.  \\n\\n3. **Overcomplicating State Management**  \\n   - AI agents don\'t always need complex memory management.  \\n   - **Solution**: For simple use cases, keep AI agents stateless and use external storage for context retention.  \\n\\n4. **Ignoring Security & Compliance**  \\n   - AI systems dealing with sensitive data need strict access controls and logging.  \\n   - **Solution**: Implement proper authentication and monitor AI interactions with internal systems.  \\n\\n### The Right Toolset for Scalable AI Agents\\n\\nTo avoid these issues, consider adopting **well-structured frameworks and tools** for building AI agents:  \\n\\n| Category | Recommended Tool/Framework |\\n|------------|----------------------------------|\\n| **Agent Frameworks** | LangChain, LlamaIndex \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f |\\n| **API Integration** | Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAPI \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffd |\\n| **LLM Hosting** | OpenAI, Hugging Face Inference API |\\n| **Orchestration** | Temporal, Prefect |\\n| **Containerization** | Docker, Kubernetes |\\n\\nChoosing the right toolset prevents unnecessary complexity and ensures **long-term maintainability**.  \\n\\n<IntentBasedAIArchitecture width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"Intent-Based AI Architecture\\" />\\n\\nFor the API integration layer, consider using **MCP** to ensure your AI agents can communicate effectively with existing systems. Here is where Agentico comes in, and where I think I can help you. \u270a\ud83c\udffd\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Thoughts: AI Agents Are Software - Treat Them Like It\\n\\nAI agents aren\'t just about machine learning - they\'re about **good software engineering**. If you think of AI tools as **microservices**, you\'ll naturally focus on **modularity, clean architecture, and scalable integration**.  \\n\\n### Key Takeaways:\\n- AI agents are **software components**, not just ML models.  \\n- **Think microservices** - build modular, API-driven architectures.  \\n- **Use MCP** to integrate AI agents with legacy and enterprise systems.  \\n- **Avoid spaghetti code** - design AI agents with maintainability in mind.  \\n\\nThe AI revolution isn\'t just about better models - it\'s about **better engineering**. Build smart, scale effectively, and make AI work for your business.  \\n\\n**What\'s your biggest challenge in building AI agents?

As enterprises grow, their workflows must evolve. We\'ve seen a big shift from simple rule-based systems to AI-driven solutions. Now, a new layer is emerging: \\"agentic\\" workflows, where AI not only gives insights but also acts on them. \\n\\nLet\'s explore three key stages:\\n\\n<AIWorkflowDiagram width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"AI Workflow Diagram\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n1. **Automated workflows (rule-based, non-AI).**\\n2. **AI workflows (non-agentic).**\\n3. **Agentic workflows (fully AI-driven).**\\n\\nWe\'ll see what each stage looks like, when it makes sense to move from one to the next, and how to do it without losing your mind\u2014or your budget.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1- Automated Workflows (Rule-Based, Non-AI)\\n\\n### What they are\\n\\nAutomated workflows rely on predefined rules. Think of it like a flowchart that never changes unless you manually update it. They typically use Business Process Model and Notation ([BPMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/About-BPMN)) and process engines such as [Camunda](https://page.camunda.com/wp-camunda-compared-to-alternatives) or other workflow automation platforms. These solutions are stable, predictable, and easy to audit. One advantage is that non-technical users can often manage them, because of the [visual representation](https://rebelion.la/visualizing-ideas-and-designs-with-diagram-as-code-tools) of the process, which is easy to understand. You can [integrate them within your existing systems](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/), like CRMs or ERPs.\\n\\n## Real-life example\\n\\n[Workflows are popular in finance, eCommerce](https://rebelion.la/experience-the-power-of-workflow-engines-in-kubernetes#heading-the-popularity-of-workflows-in-banking-ecommerce-and-beyond), healthcare, logistics, HR, customer service, well, everywhere! They are used to automate repetitive tasks, such as sending emails, updating records, or generating reports. For example, in a loan application system:\\n\\n- The system checks if the applicant\'s credit score is above a certain threshold.\\n- If yes, it sends an automated email approval.\\n- If no, it flags the case for manual review.  \\n\\nNo machine learning or advanced AI is needed. Everything is based on \\"if-this-then-that\\" logic.\\n\\n## Key benefits\\n\\n- **Reliability:** You know exactly how the system will behave.  \\n- **Clarity:** Every step is documented. You can easily track the process flow.  \\n- **Simplicity:** Anyone who understands BPMN or standard workflow logic can manage it.  \\n\\n### Drawbacks:\\n\\n- **Rigid:** Any new rule requires code or configuration changes.  \\n- **Limited intelligence:** The system can\'t learn from data or adapt on its own.  \\n- **Maintenance overhead:** As your process grows in complexity, so do the rules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2- AI Workflows (Non-Agentic)\\n\\n## What they are\\n\\nAI workflows introduce machine learning or data-driven decision-making into the process. However, the AI is mostly giving insights or predictions, not making final decisions on its own. Human approval or further system logic is still required.\\n\\n## Real-life example\\n\\nReturning to our loan system:\\n- An AI model scores each application for risk based on a variety of data points (income, credit history, spending patterns).  \\n- The workflow engine (like Camunda) still routes the application, but now the route can change based on the AI\'s risk score.  \\n- If the AI score is high-risk, the application automatically goes to a specialist. If it\'s low-risk, the system continues with automated approval steps.  \\n\\n## Key benefits\\n\\n- **Smarter decisions:** AI brings predictive power.  \\n- **Reduced manual checks:** The system flags edge cases.  \\n- **More adaptable:** AI models can be retrained as data changes.  \\n\\n## Drawbacks\\n\\n- **Complexity:** You now have to manage data pipelines, model training, and integration with your workflow tool.  \\n- **Still partially manual:** You might still need human oversight to approve or override AI decisions.  \\n- **Possible bias:** If your training data is skewed, your model could make unfair or inaccurate predictions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3- Agentic Workflows (Fully AI-Driven)\\n\\n## What they are\\n\\nAgentic workflows go a step further. The AI \\"agent\\" can plan, execute actions, and reflect on results. Instead of just scoring or suggesting, it\'s capable of taking the next step in the process automatically. This often involves large language models (LLMs) or advanced algorithms that can reason about tasks, break them down, and adapt.\\n\\n## Real-life example\\n\\nThink of an AI-driven underwriting system:\\n- The AI agent collects data from multiple sources, from bank statements to social media (if allowed).  \\n- It decides whether an application should be fast-tracked, flagged, or declined\u2014without waiting for human input.  \\n- It monitors performance. If it sees an unusual spike in defaults, it re-examines its strategy, updates its rules, and even requests new data to improve accuracy.\\n\\n## Key benefits\\n\\n- **End-to-end automation:** Minimal human intervention is needed for normal cases.  \\n- **Continuous learning:** The agent improves its decisions over time.  \\n- **Adaptive:** If new information comes in, the agent can modify its plan and respond to unexpected events.  \\n\\n## Drawbacks\\n\\n- **High complexity:** Building and maintaining an agentic workflow requires advanced AI expertise.  \\n- **Risk management:** When the AI acts independently, errors or biases can scale quickly.  \\n- **Regulatory hurdles:** In industries like finance or healthcare, letting AI run end-to-end might clash with compliance rules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to Move from Automated to AI to Agentic\\n\\n## 1. Automated (Rule-Based) \u2192 AI (Non-Agentic)\\n\\n- **When to do it:**\\n  - You have large data sets.  \\n  - You want to reduce manual tasks and errors.  \\n  - Your rules keep changing, and you need something more flexible.  \\n- **When to hold off:**\\n  - You have no reliable data or your processes are still too simple to justify the investment.  \\n\\n## 2. AI (Non-Agentic) \u2192 Agentic (Fully AI-Driven)\\n\\n- **When to do it:**\\n  - You need real-time decisions without human bottlenecks.  \\n  - Your AI models are already trusted and well-tested.  \\n  - Your regulatory environment allows for automated decision-making.  \\n- **When to hold off:**\\n  - You\'re not ready for advanced governance, auditing, and compliance.  \\n  - The cost of mistakes is too high (e.g., health diagnoses, legal matters).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Steps to Evolve Your Workflow Approach\\n\\n1. **Start with your pain points:**\\n   Look at where your rule-based system is struggling. Maybe you have too many manual reviews or too many exceptions. This is a sign you could benefit from AI.  \\n\\n2. **Assess your data readiness:**\\n   - **Data quality:** Garbage in, garbage out. Ensure your data is accurate and complete.  \\n   - **Data quantity:** For machine learning, more data is often better.  \\n   - **Security & compliance:** Check how you collect, store, and protect data.  \\n\\n3. **Pick the right tool:**\\n   - **Rule-based solutions:** BPMN engines like [Camunda](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/business-process-automation-tools/vendor/camunda/product/camunda/alternatives) can help you start simple.  \\n   - **AI add-ons:** Many workflow tools let you plug in AI services\u2014like a credit risk scoring model\u2014without rebuilding from scratch.  \\n   - **Agentic frameworks:** If you go fully agentic, you may need a specialized platform that supports advanced AI planning, reflection, and self-improvement.  \\n\\n4. **Run a pilot project:**\\n   - **Choose a low-risk use case:** Don\'t start with mission-critical tasks.  \\n   - **Measure impact:** Evaluate speed, accuracy, and cost savings.  \\n   - **Refine your approach:** Tweak rules, retrain models, or adjust the AI\'s autonomy as needed.  \\n\\n5. **Scale up gradually:**\\n   - **Train your team:** Everyone from business analysts to developers should understand how the AI works.  \\n   - **Implement governance:** Define clear escalation paths, fallback rules, and auditing.  \\n   - **Monitor performance:** Use dashboards and alerts to catch anomalies early.  \\n\\n6. **Review & repeat:**\\n   - **Regular updates:** AI models can degrade over time if the data environment changes.  \\n   - **Continuous improvement:** If agentic workflows work well for one department, see if they can help another.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Balancing Innovation and Practicality\\n\\n## The big question\\n Is it always worth going fully agentic? Not always. Many businesses find a sweet spot in AI-enhanced workflows that still have human checks at critical points. Others, especially in fast-moving tech fields, see big wins with agentic systems.  \\n\\n## Rule of thumb\\n\\n- **Go agentic** if you need real-time decisions and can handle the complexity.  \\n- **Stick to AI (non-agentic)** if your industry is regulated or you prefer human control.  \\n- **Remain automated (rule-based)** if your processes are straightforward and stable.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Road Ahead\\n\\nAutomated, AI, or agentic\u2014each stage of workflow evolution offers different levels of efficiency, intelligence, and flexibility. It\'s not about jumping to the fanciest technology just because it\'s there. It\'s about picking the approach that matches your current business needs, data maturity, and risk tolerance.\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\n- **Start small:** Don\'t boil the ocean.  \\n- **Evolve as needed:** Add AI in places where it truly helps.  \\n- **Aim for agentic only if it makes sense:** Because while a fully autonomous workflow sounds cool, it\'s not always the best fit for every enterprise.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, it\'s your customers, employees, and bottom line that matter most. Think of your workflow strategy like a staircase. Each step\u2014automated, AI, agentic\u2014has its own challenges and rewards. When you climb with care, you\'ll end up with a system that\'s not only powerful but also practical. And that\'s the real win.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on the evolution of workflows? Are you ready to take the leap into agentic workflows, or do you prefer to keep things simple?

Now, a new set of patterns is emerging in the world of Generative AI (GenAI), we are witnessing a similar revolution, one that is transforming AI from a proof-of-concept novelty into a reliable, production-ready tool. These patterns are not just interesting, but essential for building robust, scalable, and reliable AI products.\\n\\nHow can these patterns help you build smarter, more robust AI products? Let\'s dive in.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nPicture this, you are building an AI product, and you don\'t want to repeat yourself reinventing the wheel, that is where these patterns come in. They provide a common language and set of practices that help you tame the complexities of AI-driven systems.\\n\\n<DesignPatternsInAI width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"Design Patterns in AI\\" />\\n\\nMartin Fowler\'s recent article on emerging [GenAI patterns](https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/) lays out how teams can navigate the unique challenges of AI systems. At Agentico.dev, we believe that understanding these patterns isn\'t just interesting\u2014it\'s essential. We want to explore how these patterns can help you build smarter, more robust AI products, we present you the takeaways from Martin\'s article, and how to choose the right pattern for your AI product, eventhough it is not an exhaustive list, it is a good starting point, and in the Martin\'s article, the illustrations summarizes the patterns and their relationships perfectly. We will be using this illustration as a reference in this post (See below), additionally, we will provide a guide to help you choose the right pattern for your AI product.\\n\\nLet\'s start with the takeaways from Martin\'s article, and from that, we will explore how to choose the right pattern for your AI product.\\n\\n## Takeaways from Martin Fowler\'s Article\\n\\nHere are the takeaways to help you build smarter, more robust AI products.\\n\\n### 1. From POC to Production: The Evolution Demands Rigor\\n\\n**The shift is real.**  \\nGenerative AI is no longer just about flashy demos or experiments. Moving from proof-of-concept to production means grappling with real-world challenges: unpredictable outputs, hallucinations, and non-deterministic behaviors. This evolution calls for the same disciplined engineering practices that built the software systems we rely on today.  \\n*Key insight:* Treat AI development with the same rigor as any critical system\u2014build tests, set benchmarks, and continually monitor performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Patterns as a Compass: Guiding Design in Uncharted Territory\\n\\n**Old lessons, new challenges.**  \\nRemember how the Gang of Four patterns and microservices architecture changed software development? In GenAI, emerging patterns are doing the same. They provide a common language and set of practices that help us tame the complexities of AI-driven systems.  \\n*Key insight:* Leverage these patterns to standardize your approach, reduce risk, and build more predictable, scalable AI solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Evals: Your Quality Gate for Non-Deterministic Systems\\n\\n**Not all outputs are created equal.**  \\nWith traditional software, you can often predict what will happen. But AI systems are inherently non-deterministic\u2014same input, different output. That\'s why rigorous evaluation (or \\"evals\\") is critical. Evals help you measure accuracy, relevance, and coherence across a wide range of scenarios.  \\n*Key insight:* Integrate systematic evaluations into your build pipeline to ensure your AI behaves as intended. Think of evals as your quality gate before any release.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. RAG: Bridging the Gap Between Data and Context\\n\\n**Bringing context to life.**  \\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is more than a buzzword. It\'s a pattern that enhances AI by retrieving relevant information from external data sources, then using that context to improve output quality. This is especially important when working with large language models that might otherwise rely solely on static training data.  \\n*Key insight:* Use RAG to infuse your models with up-to-date and domain-specific information, ensuring your AI remains both accurate and contextually aware.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Embeddings: Simplifying Complexity with Smart Compression\\n\\n**Making sense of high-dimensional data.**  \\nEmbeddings are at the heart of many AI systems. They compress vast amounts of data\u2014whether text, images, or other formats\u2014into compact numerical vectors. This makes it possible to measure similarity, find patterns, and perform efficient searches.  \\n*Key insight:* Embrace embeddings to transform raw data into a format that\'s easier to work with. They\'re the unsung heroes that let AI understand and compare complex information quickly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. Guardrails: Balancing Automation with Safety\\n\\n**Keep the AI in check.**  \\nAI\'s ability to generate impressive outputs comes with risks\u2014incorrect information, biased responses, or even unsafe content. Implementing guardrails (like separate layers of validation or additional model calls) can help mitigate these risks.  \\n*Key insight:* Design your systems with built-in safeguards. It\'s not just about making AI work; it\'s about making it work safely and responsibly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Real-World Wisdom: Learning from Hands-On Experience\\n\\n**Theory meets practice.**  \\nMartin Fowler\'s insights aren\'t just academic\u2014they come from real-world engagements with clients across various industries. His work reminds us that while patterns provide a framework, they\'re not one-size-fits-all. Context matters, and flexibility is key.  \\n*Key insight:* Adapt the patterns to your unique challenges. Use the lessons learned from real implementations to continuously refine and improve your approach.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **AI Patterns and Their Role in GenAI**\\n\\n<AIPatternsAndTheirRoleInGenAI width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"AI Patterns and Their Role in GenAI\\" />\\n\\nThe patterns are interesting and essential for building robust, scalable, and reliable AI products. They provide a common language and set of practices that help you tame the complexities of AI-driven systems.\\n\\nIn an Agentic approach, we use these patterns to interact with AI models and to build AI workflows that are either deterministic or non-deterministic. We use these patterns to build AI workflows that can interact with users, other AI agents, or multiple AI models.\\n\\n![GenAI Design Patterns](./GenAI-Design-Patterns.gif)\\n> <small>Source: [Martin Fowler\'s Article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#PuttingTogetherARealisticRag)</small>\\n\\nFor traditional software developers embarking on their AI journey, these patterns may initially seem daunting. However, they are not vastly different from the patterns we\'ve been using in software engineering. They are simply a new set of patterns specific to AI. To ease the transition, we\'ve developed a quadrant to guide you in selecting the right pattern for your AI implementation.\\n\\n### AI Patterns Quadrant Analysis\\n\\nThe quadrant, designed to **help you determine when and why** to use each AI pattern, is valuable. It strikes a balance between complexity and scope, aiding developers in deciding **which** pattern is necessary for their specific AI implementation.  \\n\\n<DesignPatternsQuadrantAnalysis width=\\"90%\\" alt=\\"Design Patterns Quadrant Analysis\\" />\\n\\nLet\'s take the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) as an example. This robust tool allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to effortlessly interact with external data and tools. It provides a standardized schema that guarantees structured communication between AI models and their environments environment.\\n\\nAssuming that you want to build a solution leveraging an [MCP compliant client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), we are going to defrief an hypothetical workflow and the integrations.\\n\\n**Direct Prompting:** Starting with a single interaction with an AI model, you can use the [MCP Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts) which are predefined prompts that can interact with the LLM. In this case, you don\'t need to worry about malicious inputs, because the prompts are predefined, and the LLM is not directly exposed to the user input.\\n\\nManaging user inputs is a key part of creating a safe experience, and ensuring that user intent is positive is crucial to prevent any harmful submissions that could put LLMs at risk. This is where **Guardrails** play a significant role! By implementing [execution rails](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/user_guides/guardrails-process.html), you help protect the LLM from any malicious inputs, keeping everything secure. It\u2019s also really important to have output rails in place to make sure that the results are both safe and suitable for the user and the context they\u2019re in. \\n\\nIn the implementation of our hypothetical MCP workflow, in your MCP Server you can use the Claude\'s guidelines to [strenghten guardrails](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/) and rely on [prompting the LLM](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling#system-prompt) to ensure that the inputs and outputs are safe; of course, *human-in-the-loop* is not the best approach for production systems, but it can be useful for prototyping or internal tools with \\"**advanced users in the loop**\\", in enterprise environments *human-in-the-loop* is the best approach to ensure that the AI is behaving as expected.\\n\\n![Programmable Guardrails Flow](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/_static/images/programmable_guardrails_flow.png)\\n> <small>Source: [NVIDIA Guardrails](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/user_guides/guardrails-process.html)</small>\\n\\nContinuing with the workflow, you should retrieve information from external data sources; this is where **RAG**, **Embeddings**, and **Hybrid Retriever** come in. You can use RAG to retrieve relevant information from external data sources and then use that context to improve the output quality of the LLM. You should use **Embeddings** to transform raw data into an easier-to-work-with format. This is useful when measuring similarity, finding patterns, and performing efficient searches.\\n\\nIn our MCP workflow, we can use **Query Rewriting** with the [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling) features of the MCP protocol. This allows the MCP Server to rewrite the user query or prompt to improve the retrieval of relevant information from external data sources. This is useful when you want to improve the relevance of the information retrieved and fine tune the output of the LLM.\\n\\nBelow is the quadrant for determining **when and why** to use each AI pattern should balance complexity and scope, helping developers decide **which** pattern is necessary.\\n\\n<AIPatternsQuadrant alt=\\"AI Patterns Quadrant\\" />\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Wrapping Up\\n\\nThe journey from innovative ideas to robust, production-ready AI systems is full of twists and turns. By embracing these emerging [AI patterns](https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/), you can navigate the complexities of generative AI with a more informed, systematic approach. Agentic AI will prosper if developers leverage these patterns!\\n\\nAt [\\"La Rebelion\\"](https://rebelion.la), we are passionate about helping teams transform emerging technologies into reliable products. Whether you\'re just starting with AI or looking to refine your approach, these takeaways offer a solid foundation for your journey.\\n\\nStay innovative, stay bold, and let\'s build the future of AI together.

MCP is a powerful tool that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external data and tools seamlessly. However, to unlock its full potential, we need to address a critical challenge: **standardizing MCP implementation**.\\n\\n<NavigatingFragmentation width=\\"90%\\" />\\n\\nIn this post, we\'ll explore why MCP needs a standardized implementation pattern and how Agentico can help revolutionize AI development.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIf you\'ve ever tried integrating LLMs into enterprise environments, air-gapped systems, or zero-trust architectures, you know the pain. Every team builds their own interpretation of MCP, making interoperability a nightmare. The absence of clear implementation standards slows down development, increases maintenance costs, and introduces unnecessary complexity.\\n\\n## MCP: A Powerful Yet Fractured Landscape\\n\\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a game-changer for AI applications, offering a seamless way to integrate LLMs with external data and tools. It brings a standardized schema, ensuring structured communication between AI models and their environment. However, there\'s a critical gap: **client-side integration is straightforward, but server-side implementation is a maze**.\\n\\nRight now, if you\'re an AI developer looking to integrate MCP on the server side, you\'re faced with a wild west of implementations. There\'s no clear, standardized way to do it - **everyone builds their own version**. This fragmentation stifles innovation and makes AI projects collaboration far more complex than it needs to be.\\n\\n### The Challenge of Fragmentation\\n\x3c!-- centered --\x3e\\n<EstablishingStandard width=\\"90%\\" />\\n\\nFragmentation is a significant barrier to AI development. It leads to:\\n\\n* **Wasted time and resources** as teams struggle to understand and integrate different implementations.\\n* **Increased complexity** due to inconsistent implementations.\\n* **Security risks** as each implementation may have its own set of vulnerabilities.\\n* **Vendor lock-in** as teams become dependent on a single implementation reducing flexibility and interoperability.\\n* **Slower time to market** as teams waste time on custom integrations with backend systems.\\n* **Higher maintenance overhead** as each implementation requires its own set of updates.\\n\\n### The Enterprise Struggle: LLMs in Closed Environments\\n\\n<LLMsInClosedEnvironments />\\n\\nEnterprises and developers are increasingly looking to deploy LLMs in **air-gapped and zero-trust environments**, but without an MCP standard, they\'re left to **build custom implementations for every use case**. This lack of predictability makes AI adoption harder, stalling innovation and increasing operational overhead.. This is a significant barrier to AI adoption in enterprise environments.\\n\\nIsolation and maintenance overhead are significant barriers to AI adoption in enterprise environments.\\n\\n## Bridging the Gap in AI Development with a Standardized MCP Implementation\\n\\nTo fix this, we need a standard way to implement MCP on the backend. That is where **Agentico** comes in. Agentico is an open-source framework that provides a **structured, reusable approach to MCP implementation**, making integration seamless across projects and teams.\\n\\n<AIPotentialUnleashed width=\\"90%\\" />\\n\\nAgentico is more than just an implementation of MCP - it\'s the de facto pattern for server-side MCP integration. By defining a structured, standardized way to implement MCP on the backend, Agentico **eliminates guesswork, accelerates development, and ensures interoperability** between AI tools from different vendors.\\n\\nImagine being able to:\\n\\n* **Spin up a standardized, MCP-compliant server** with just a few commands.\\n* **Ensure compatibility** between AI models and tools.\\n* **Eliminate unnecessary backend complexity** so you can focus on building AI applications.\\n* **Collaborate more effectively** with standardized workflows.\\n* Generate AI Agents with **boilerplate code** for multiple languages and frameworks.\\n\\n<AIDevelopmentFramework />\\n\\nAgentic AI is a powerful concept, but it\'s only as good as its implementation. Agentico doesn\'t just solve a technical problem - it empowers AI developers to focus on building innovative applications instead of reinventing the wheel.\\n\\n## Why Standardization Matters\\n\\n<WhyStandardizationMatters width=\\"85%\\" />\\n\\nTo understand the importance of Agentico, let\'s break down two key concepts:\\n\\n1. **What\'s a Protocol?**\\n\\nA protocol is a set of rules that allow different systems to communicate effectively. MCP is a protocol that ensures LLMs can interact with external tools in a structured way. **Protocols bring predictability, but without standard implementations, they can still be difficult to adopt.**\\n\\n2. **What\'s a Standard?**\\n\\nA standard is an agreed-upon method that ensures consistency and interoperability. For example, RESTful APIs became the standard for web communication, **making it easier for developers to build web services without reinventing HTTP communication.**\\n\\n<StandardizingMCP />\\n\\nA protocol like MCP defines **how things should work**, but without a **consistent implementation pattern**, adoption remains fragmented. Think about how Swagger (OpenAPI) revolutionized web APIs or how `npm` standardized JavaScript dependencies. **Agentico aims to do the same for MCP**.\\n\\n## The Bigger Picture: Making AI Lifecycle Management Easier\\n\\nAI applications are rapidly evolving, but their success depends on robust **lifecycle management** - from model training to deployment and maintenance. By standardizing server-side MCP implementation, Agentico makes AI lifecycle management **smoother, scalable, and more developer-friendly**.\\n\\nAI can assist in every aspect of the development lifecycle, from code generation to testing and deployment, but still, clean code is essential to facilitate maintenance and collaboration. Without a structured, standardized approach, code can become easily scattered and difficult to manage (as this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1ibtjri/my_project_became_so_big_that_claude_cant/) illustrates). Without a standardized implementation pattern, AI tools remain fragmented, making it difficult to integrate them into existing workflows.\\n\\n<DevExpVSAIInteraction />\\n\\nFor AI developers, this means:\\n\\n* **Faster time to market** with reduced backend complexity.\\n* **Less maintenance overhead** with a well-defined structure.\\n* **Greater collaboration** as teams work within a consistent framework.\\n\\n## Let\'s Build the Future of AI Together\\n\\nThe AI community thrives on shared innovation. By adopting and contributing to Agentico, we\'re not just simplifying MCP implementation - we\'re shaping the future of AI development. I\'m developing **MCP standardization tools in Java and TypeScript**, and I want your feedback.

As our systems become increasingly distributed and interconnected, understanding every step of an AI workflow isn\'t just a luxury - it\'s a necessity. Let\'s dive into how OpenTelemetry can help you achieve this level of observability in your AI systems, in this post we will explore how the Agentico SDK and the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) empower you to harness [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), ensuring your AI tools are not only powerful but also observable and debuggable.\\n\\n## The Complexity of Distributed AI Systems\\n\\n![Agentic AI Framework](./agentic-framework-light.png)\\n\\nModern AI systems are distributed by nature. They interact with various APIs, databases, and microservices, each potentially hosted in different environments - from local Docker containers to sprawling cloud infrastructures. This complexity introduces challenges like latency issues, data synchronization, and hidden bottlenecks that can slow down performance or, worse, lead to errors that are hard to diagnose.\\n\\n### The Challenge: Debugging Black-Box AI Workflows\\n\\nImagine trying to debug an AI system without any insight into its internal workings. When something goes wrong, you\'re left guessing which component failed or which microservice caused the delay. That\'s where observability tools come into play. By instrumenting your AI tools, you can trace the flow of data, monitor performance, and quickly identify problems. This is not just about fixing bugs - it\'s about optimizing and scaling your systems effectively.\\n\\n### OpenTelemetry: The Observability Game-Changer\\n\\nOpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source observability framework that provides standardized tools to collect and export traces, metrics, and logs from your applications. When integrated into your AI tools, OTel offers:\\n\\n* **End-to-End Tracing:** Capture every step in your AI workflow - from data ingestion to model inference.\\n* **Enhanced Debugging:** Quickly locate performance bottlenecks or failure points.\\n* **Comprehensive Metrics:** Monitor response times, error rates, and resource utilization.\\n* **Seamless Integration:** With Agentico SDK, much of the heavy lifting is handled for you. \\n  * Focus on building your AI tools, and let Agentico and OTel handle the observability.\\n  * Give it a try to the Agentico\'s [`mcp-create-tool`](https://agentico.dev/docs/quickstart/create-a-server/) and see how easy it is to create a new server with OpenTelemetry support.\\n\\nBy embedding OTel in your AI stack, you\'re not only enhancing your system\'s reliability but also improving the developer experience (DevEx) with actionable insights and streamlined debugging.\\n\\n## Why Observability Matters in Agentic AI Systems\\n\\nDistributed AI systems are inherently complex, with multiple moving parts that interact in real time. Observability is crucial for understanding how these components work together, identifying performance bottlenecks, and ensuring the reliability of your AI workflows. Here\'s why observability is essential in **agentic AI systems**:\\n\\n\u2705 **Latency:** Agents may rely on multiple APIs, models, and tools. Understanding execution delays is critical.\\n\\n\u2705 **Synchronization:** AI agents often run **parallel** or **chained** tasks. Tracing dependencies ensures consistency.\\n\\n\u2705 **Data Consistency:** AI models process streaming data from various sources. Without observability, detecting inconsistencies is difficult.\\n\\n\u2705 **Error Diagnosis:** AI agents rely on **prompts, vector databases, and APIs**. Debugging failures without traces is nearly impossible.\\n\\n\u2705 **Performance Optimization:** Observability helps you identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and scale your AI systems effectively.\\n\\nBy integrating OpenTelemetry into your AI tools, you gain a **360-degree view** of your AI workflows, enabling you to monitor, debug, and optimize your systems with ease.\\n\\n## Benefits of OpenTelemetry for MCP-Enabled AI Tools\\n\\n![AI Framework Components](./ai-framework-components-w.png)\\n\\nMCP is being adopted by AI developers worldwide for its flexibility, it\'s becoming the standard for AI tooling. Cline, Cursor, LibreChat, and other [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) are already using the Model Context Protocol to simplify AI workflows.\\n\\n**The Agentico SDK is designed with AI developers in mind**. It simplifies the creation of new AI tools using the `mcp-create-tool` CLI, which auto-generates a standard MCP [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) project, but it **also includes built-in OpenTelemetry support**. Here\'s how it makes your life easier:\\n\\n### Enhanced Developer Experience (DevEx)\\n\\n* **Modular Monitoring:** Each AI component - workflow manager, data pipeline, and processing layers - operates independently but remains fully traceable, making debugging and optimization effortless.\\n* **End-to-End Traceability:** Follow every request across services and microservices with trace IDs, ensuring full visibility into how data moves through your system.\\n* **Real-Time Insights:** Instantly detect performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and failures with live telemetry data, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.\\n* **Rapid Debugging:** When an issue arises, you can quickly drill down to the exact point of failure. This means less time spent in the weeds and more time innovating.\\n* **Intuitive Monitoring:** Visualize your AI workflow with familiar tools like Jaeger or Zipkin. Everything is accessible, making it easier to maintain and improve your system.\\n\\n### Operational Efficiency\\n\\n* **Proactive Issue Resolution:** With real-time tracing, you can catch potential issues before they escalate. This proactive approach leads to fewer system downtimes and improved performance.\\n* **Scalability:** As your AI systems grow, the need for robust observability only increases. OpenTelemetry scales with your system, ensuring you maintain full visibility regardless of complexity.\\n* **Data-Driven Insights:** The metrics and logs collected via OTel empower you to make informed decisions. Optimize performance, refine workflows, and ultimately, build smarter AI systems.\\n\\n### Empowering Your AI Workflows\\n\\n* **Seamless Integration:** Auto-generated code for OpenTelemetry setup eliminates the complexity of manual instrumentation, so you can focus on building AI solutions instead of troubleshooting them. Whether you\'re running locally on Docker or scaling up in production, you maintain control and insight.\\n* **Improved Reliability:** By instrumenting your tools, you create a system where errors are quickly identifiable and resolvable. This leads to more reliable AI deployments and a better end-user experience.\\n* **Innovation and Growth:** With deep insights into every part of your workflow, you\'re free to experiment and innovate. Understanding the nuances of your system\'s performance gives you the power to iterate faster and build more resilient AI solutions.\\n\\nWith OpenTelemetry and Agentico SDK, you\'re not just building AI tools - you\'re ensuring they run efficiently, transparently, and at scale. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## \u270a\ud83c\udffb HANDS-ON: How to Enable OpenTelemetry in MCP with Agentico SDK\\n\\nHere\'s how you can integrate OpenTelemetry into your AI tools using **Agentico SDK (TypeScript example):** \\n\\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Create an MCP Tool with OpenTelemetry Support\\n\\nUse the `mcp-create-tool` CLI to generate a new AI tool with OpenTelemetry support:\\n```bash\\nmcp-create-tool agentico-project -n \\"My first agentico tool\\" -t echo -d \\"A simple echo tool.\\\\n\\\\nThis tool will echo back the input data.\\" --instrumentation\\n```\\n\\nThis command creates a new AI tool in `agentico-project` directory with an `echo` tool type and a description. The tool is automatically configured with OpenTelemetry instrumentation. \\nAlso, it generates a Docker compose file and a bash script to start the tool and the OTel backend, either [OTel Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs), and [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io).\\n\\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Start OpenTelemetry Collector\\n\\nTo collect and visualize traces, run an **OpenTelemetry Collector** container. When you start the collector with no arguments, this starts Otel, to run \\"jaeger\\" or \\"zipkin\\" just add the extra argument string as shown here.\\n\\nJaeger\'s backend can receive trace data from the OpenTelemetry SDKs in their native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), but Zipkin can\'t, so you need to use the OpenTelemetry Collector to export the traces to Zipkin.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nIf you want to use Jaeger instead, **DO NOT** start the OTel collector, just run the script with the `jaeger` argument, because by default, the generated docker compose defaults the port to 4318 in both cases. This is to make it transparent for the user, but you can change it in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n```bash\\ncd agentico-project\\n./agenticotel.sh\\n```\\n\\n(Optional) If you want to visualize traces in **Zipkin**, run:\\n```bash\\n./agenticotel.sh zipkin\\n```\\n\\nAccess Zipkin UI at **[http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411)**.\\n\\n\\nIf you want to visualize traces in **Jaeger**, run:\\n```bash\\n./agenticotel.sh jaeger\\n```\\n\\nAccess Jaeger UI at **[http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)**.\\n\\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Start Your AI Tool\\n\\nStart your AI tool with OpenTelemetry support:\\n\\n```bash\\n# If you aren\'t in the agentico-project directory\\ncd agentico-project\\n# Let\'s start the tool with the MCP inspector\\nnpm install\\nnpm run build\\nnpm run start\\nnpm run inspector\\n```\\n\\nRunning the inspector will start the tool and the inspector, which is a web interface to interact with the tool, access it at **[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)**.\\n\\nIf you prefer, you can use the Claude Desktop to interact with the tool, just add the server configuration to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.\\n\\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Interact with Your AI Tool\\n\\nNow that your AI tool is running, you can interact with it using the MCP inspector or Claude Desktop. Send prompts, view responses, and monitor traces in real time!! As you see in the video, you can interact with the tool and see the traces in the Jaeger UI, and Zipkin UI.\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n  <tr>     \\n    <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n      <b>MCP Inspector</b>\\n      ![MCP Inspector](./mcp-inspector.png)\\n    </td>\\n    <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n      <b>Zipkin Traces</b>\\n      ![Zipkin Traces](./zipkin-ui.png)\\n    </td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nThe future of AI development is observability-driven. By leveraging OpenTelemetry within the Agentico SDK and embracing the MCP framework, AI developers can finally lift the veil on complex distributed systems.\\n\\n![OpenTelemetry in Agentico SDK](./opentelemetry.io_docs.png)\\n\\nNo more working in the dark. With integrated observability, every component of your AI system is visible, traceable, and optimized for success. This isn\'t just about debugging\u2014it\'s about building smarter, more resilient AI that scales with your vision.\\n\\nI invite you to explore these tools, experiment with new ideas, and share your experiences. Let\'s push the boundaries of what AI can achieve together.\\n\\nHappy coding, and may your AI workflows always be transparent, Go Rebels!

Docker","permalink":"/blog/ollama-run-deepseek-on-docker"}},"content":"GitHub has entered the AI model hosting space with **[GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models)**, a platform that allows developers to find, experiment with, and integrate AI models directly into their workflows. The latest addition to this service is **DeepSeek-R1**, a powerful large language model (LLM) now available in **public preview**.\\n\\n## What is GitHub Models?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![GitHub Models](./github-marketplace-models.png)\\n\\nIf you\'re familiar with **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)** (*with its vast collection of AI models, more than 1.3 million models as when this article was written*), then you\'ll immediately recognize the intent behind **GitHub Models**. This service enables developers to:\\n\\n- **Find AI models** for various tasks (NLP, code generation, etc.).\\n- **Try, compare, and implement models** via a playground or API.\\n- **Use AI models from the command line** with **GitHub CLI** or integrate them as **Copilot extensions**.\\n- **Leverage a free API (currently in public preview)** to test AI capabilities.\\n\\nEssentially, it\'s Microsoft/GitHub\'s answer to Hugging Face\u2014a move that could shift where developers go for AI integrations. Although GitHub Models is still in its early stages, the addition of **DeepSeek-R1** is a significant step forward. At the time of writing this article, I counted only 22 models available in the [GitHub Models\' marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models).\\n\\n## Why DeepSeek-R1 Matters \ud83d\udc0b\\n\\n![DeepSeek-R1](./github-models-deepseek.png)\\n\\nDeepSeek-R1 is an advanced **large-scale AI model** designed to push the boundaries of **deep learning, NLP, and computer vision**. Here\'s why it\'s important:\\n\\n1. **Massive Scale** \u2013 This model is among the most potent publicly available LLMs.\\n2. **Free Public Preview** \u2013 Developers can experiment with it **for free** via GitHub Models\' **playground or API**.\\n3. **Side-by-Side Comparisons** \u2013 GitHub Models allows users to [compare DeepSeek-R1 against other models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azureml-deepseek/DeepSeek-R1/playground?compare_to=o1).\\n4. **Command-Line and Copilot Integration** \u2013 You can test and implement it directly using **GitHub CLI** or within **GitHub Copilot**.\\n5. **Future of AI Model Hosting** \u2013 This release signals GitHub\'s ambition to compete with Hugging Face and **become the go-to hub for AI model distribution**.\\n\\n## GitHub Models vs. Hugging Face: The Bigger Picture\\n\\n### Microsoft\'s AI Strategy\\nWith GitHub Models, Microsoft is expanding its **AI ecosystem**, making it easier for developers to consume LLMs without leaving GitHub. This aligns with their broader strategy:\\n\\n- **Deep OpenAI Partnership** \u2013 Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI and is integrating AI models directly into its products.\\n- **GitHub Copilot** \u2013 AI-assisted coding is already integrated into GitHub; now, models like DeepSeek-R1 will enhance this further.\\n- **Azure AI Integration?** \u2013 It\'s likely that GitHub Models will eventually tie into **Azure AI**, pushing enterprise adoption.\\n\\n### Hugging Face\'s Edge\\nHugging Face has been the dominant **developer-first** AI model hub. It has:\\n- A **strong open-source community**.\\n- A **large collection of pre-trained models**.\\n- **Collaborative tools** for fine-tuning and deploying models.\\n\\nThe key battle will be **ecosystem lock-in** - GitHub has a vast user base, but Hugging Face has deep community trust.\\n\\n## Getting Started with DeepSeek-R1 on GitHub Models\\n\\n![Models Comparison](./github-models-compare-llms-side-by-side.png)\\n\\nWant to try **DeepSeek-R1** yourself? Here\'s how:\\n\\n- **Use the Playground** \u2013 Experiment with the model for free.\\n- **Try the API** \u2013 Integrate DeepSeek-R1 into your own applications.\\n- **Compare AI Models** \u2013 Test its performance against other models with GitHub\'s side-by-side comparison feature.\\n- **Run from CLI** \u2013 Use the **GitHub CLI** for quick testing.\\n- **Extend Copilot** \u2013 Integrate DeepSeek-R1 as a **Copilot extension**.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 [Official GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/integrating-ai-models-into-your-development-workflow#using-ai-models-from-the-command-line)\\n\\nI tested the chat section of DeepSeek-R1 with the following prompt:\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\n\\"Can you explain Agentic AI and how I can start integrating it with Agentico.dev (documentation: https://agentico.dev/docs)?\\"\\n\\n:::\\n\\nIt was a way for me to validate the model\'s understanding of a complex question, and to test if my documentation is clear an enough. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nThe response was impressive, showing the model\'s ability to comprehend and generate human-like text, did you notice it\'s reasoning about the documentation and how it\'s line of thought is structured? \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nWell, the bad news is that it can\'t access the internet, so it can\'t check the documentation for you. \ud83e\udd7a\\n\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\"  style={{\\"aspect-ratio\\": \\"16 / 9\\"}} src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBaRkTDEJWQ\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen>\\n</iframe>\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Sample Code: Running DeepSeek-R1 in JavaScript**\\n\\nTo authenticate with the model you will need to generate a personal access token (PAT) in your GitHub settings. Create your PAT token by following instructions here: [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).\\n\\n> This is the example you can find in the GitHub Models\' playground:\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\n/*\\n$ npm install @azure-rest/ai-inference @azure/core-auth @azure/core-sse\\n*/\\nimport ModelClient from \\"@azure-rest/ai-inference\\";\\nimport { AzureKeyCredential } from \\"@azure/core-auth\\";\\n// Your PAT token\\nconst token = process.env[\\"GITHUB_TOKEN\\"];\\n\\nexport async function main() {\\n    const client = new ModelClient(\\n        \\"https://models.inference.ai.azure.com\\",\\n        new AzureKeyCredential(token)\\n    );\\n\\n    const response = await client.path(\\"/chat/completions\\").post({\\n        body: {\\n            messages: [\\n                { role: \\"user\\", content: \\"Can you explain what Agentic AI is and how I can start integrating it with Agentico.dev (documentation: https://agentico.dev/docs?)\\" }\\n            ],\\n            model: \\"DeepSeek-R1\\",\\n            max_tokens: 2048,\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\n    if (response.status !== \\"200\\") {\\n        throw response.body.error;\\n    }\\n    console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content);\\n}\\n\\nmain().catch((err) => {\\n    console.error(\\"The sample encountered an error:\\", err);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Final Thoughts: A New AI Hub in the Making?\\nGitHub Models is **a significant move** in the AI model space. It gives developers a new way to **discover, compare, and integrate AI models** - right where they already code. While **Hugging Face** remains the leader in **open-source AI**, GitHub Models has the potential to disrupt the landscape, especially with **Microsoft\'s backing** and deep integration with **Copilot and GitHub Actions**.\\n\\nWill GitHub Models become the preferred AI hub for developers? Time will tell, but the competition is heating up. \ud83d\udd25\\n\\nHave you tried **DeepSeek-R1** yet?
