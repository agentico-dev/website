With Agentico we aim to provide a simple, secure and easy-to-use platform for developers, **and** business users. Built on the foundation of the MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)), Agentico provides a simplified way to manage agentic workflows. This tool enhances collaboration and efficiency across various projects in an organization, allowing teams to work together seamlessly.  Additionally, it offers robust features for tracking progress and ensuring accountability in team efforts.
