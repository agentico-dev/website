# Execute a Non Deterministic Workflow

A non-deterministic workflow is a sequence of tasks that can be executed in any order, and the output may vary depending on the order of execution. This type of workflow is useful when you need to run tasks in parallel, or when the order of execution is not important, or when the output of one task is the input of another task to achieve complex tasks.
